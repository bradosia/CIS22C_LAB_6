# Instructions
Programming Problem 5 on page 491 of the book (screenshot below) :

- Just names (format: fname lname) and birthdays (format: yyyy-mm-dd) as data attributes are sufficient.
- Implement your BST as a link-based ADT - you may be able to reuse your Node classes from Labs 2 and 2b.
- For the data, create a text file of data in a random fashion - name or birthday entry per line.
- Read the data to create your BST for the database by name or birthday as needed - remember two different trees will be needed and the node insertions will be different depending on which data tree it is.
- Write out the listing of everyone by name to a file (separate from your input) using a post-order traversal mechanism.
- Write out the listing of everyone by birthday to a different file using a breadth-first traversal mechanism.
- Include your code source tree, input text file and the two output files in your zip upload. Only one file upload is allowed.
- Ensure I can run the programs by changing the data in your files without having to fix your code for file locations.

Any other questions or clarifications - ask on the forum first.
