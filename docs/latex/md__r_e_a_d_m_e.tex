Programming Problem 5 on page 491 of the book (screenshot below) \+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Just names (format\+: fname lname) and birthdays (format\+: yyyy-\/mm-\/dd) as data attributes are sufficient.
\item Implement your B\+ST as a link-\/based A\+DT -\/ you may be able to reuse your Node classes from Labs 2 and 2b.
\item For the data, create a text file of data in a random fashion -\/ name or birthday entry per line.
\item Read the data to create your B\+ST for the database by name or birthday as needed -\/ remember two different trees will be needed and the node insertions will be different depending on which data tree it is.
\item Write out the listing of everyone by name to a file (separate from your input) using a post-\/order traversal mechanism.
\item Write out the listing of everyone by birthday to a different file using a breadth-\/first traversal mechanism.
\item Include your code source tree, input text file and the two output files in your zip upload. Only one file upload is allowed.
\item Ensure I can run the programs by changing the data in your files without having to fix your code for file locations.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Any other questions or clarifications -\/ ask on the forum first.
